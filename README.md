## Good to know

This project is really dusty, musty and old. I just came here again to make the README better, if you want to use scrcpy, you're better off using the original project, because of my 'amazing coding skills' at that time, this is probably harder to set up than original scrcpy, I am archiving this project and removing all download links, thanks for understanding and see ya
