## Good to know

This project is really dusty, musty and old. I just came here again to make the README better, if you want to use scrcpy, you're better off using the original project, because of my 'amazing coding skills' at that time, this is probably harder to set up than original scrcpy, I am archiving this project and removing all download links, thanks for understanding and see ya

## Comeback

Now you might have come back here all sad, thinking about what you would do (no one is here), but don't worry, the project is going to come back, and is going to be even better! And you, the user, will just have to wait
